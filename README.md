## Typerace App Using React Hooks

### `useState`

`const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);`

Returns a stateful value, and a function to update it.

During the initial render, the returned state (`state`) is the same as the value passed as the first argument (`initialState`).

The `setState` function is used to update the state. It accepts a new state value and enqueues a re-render of the component.

### `useEffect`

`useEffect(didUpdate);`

Accepts a function that contains imperative, possibly effectful code.

Mutations, subscriptions, timers, logging, and other side effects are not allowed inside the main body of a function component (referred to as React’s render phase). Doing so will lead to confusing bugs and inconsistencies in the UI.

Instead, use `useEffect`. The function passed to `useEffect` will run after the render is committed to the screen. Think of effects as an escape hatch from React’s purely functional world into the imperative world.

By default, effects run after every completed render, but you can choose to fire them only when certain values have changed.

### `useContext`

`const value = useContext(MyContext);`

Accepts a context object (the value returned from `React.createContext`) and returns the current context `value` for that context. The current context value is determined by the value prop of the nearest `<MyContext.Provider>` above the calling component in the tree.

When the nearest `<MyContext.Provider>` above the component updates, this Hook will trigger a rerender with the latest context `value` passed to that `MyContext` provider. Even if an ancestor uses `React.memo` or `shouldComponentUpdate`, a rerender will still happen starting at the component itself using `useContext`.


## This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
